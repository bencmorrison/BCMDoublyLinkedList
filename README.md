# BCMDoublyLinkedList
`BCMDoublyLinkedList` is the Swift equivalent, and surpassing of `BMDoublyLinkedList` which is Obj-C.

This project is here for me to implment various things from Swift to gain an understanding of how they work. What is a better place to build skills than creating a data structure in a new language?
